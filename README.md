# ASP2024
Course material for the **A**frican **S**chool of **P**hysics 2024, Marrakesh, Morocco.

At ASP2022 a workshop on small physics experiments and the **I**nternet **o**f **T**hings (IoT) has been integrated for the first time. This is a hands-on workshop where the students create small experiments using electronic sensors (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure) and actuators (Leds, TFT display, stepping motors). The sensors are read and the actuators are controlled with simple Python programs. 
The laboratory equipment consists of
* an ESP32 CPU card with a MicroPython interpreter installed in its flash memory
  a user programmable LED connected to a **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**npout **O**utput (GPIO) line on the CPU card
* a 3 slot backplane connecting the CPU to the sensors and actuators
* a 10 k&Omega

This is work in progress.
