a=6	     # assigns the integer value 5 to the variable a
             # the “#” sign denotes a comment
f=5.8        # assigns the floating point value 5.8to the
             # variable f 
b=True	     # b takes the boolean value true 
s="Hello"    # s is assigned the string “Hello”
l=[1,2,3,5]  # l is a list with values 1,2,3,5
t=(1,2,3,5)  # t is a tuple with the same values
             # tuples are similar to lists by they are
             # immutable
a = a+3      # would be a illegal equation but is a perfectly legal
             # assignment
print(a,f,b,s,l,t)
